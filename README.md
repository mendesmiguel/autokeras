Auto-Keras is an automated machine learning (AutoML) package based on Keras.
It aims at automatically searching for the architecture and hyperparameters for deep learning models.
The ultimate goal of this project is to enable domain experts in fields other than computer science or machine learning
accessible to deep learning models conveniently.

To install the package please use the commend as follows:

    pip install autokeras

Here is a short example of using the package.


    import autokeras as ak

    clf = ak.ImageClassifier()
    clf.fit(x_train, y_train)
    results = clf.predict(x_test)
